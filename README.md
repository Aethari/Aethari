Hi there! I'm DJaySky, an American solo dev with a focus on games and systems programming. I've haven't made much, but I'm on my way to completing
several projects.

My GitHub page probably doesn't look pretty impressive right now, but I'm working on big things for the future. I'm sure I'll take little bits and
pieces from my larger projects to make into smaller ones (like [MLog](https://github.com/DJaySky/MLog)), so keep checking back to see if I made 
something new :)

## Current projects:
- An unnamed, raycasted dungeon crawler with a built in engine, written in C+Lua with SDL3
- A single header GUI library for SDL3
- **[Development calendar](Calendar.md)**

### Future projects:
These are things that I **want** to make in the future. Whether or not they will actually get done is another story.
- Modern, customizable application launcher for Linux
- A (kind of) general purpose raycasting game engine
- A simple 2D game engine
- Some smaller tools to go with the engines
- A TUI/CLI (haven't decided yet) file browser that isn't terrible to use
- Pomodoro tracking app (desktop and terminal)
- A modern Nano clone focused on simplicity and usability

## Skills:
- C
- Lua
- C+Lua interfaces
- SDL
- Small, specific scripts
- Game engines
- Terminal apps

## Here's some things about me:
- **Favorite language(s):** C+Lua (really just Lua, but C is too powerful to ignore)
- **Favorite text editor:** Nano/Micro
- **Favorite game:** ULTRAKILL/Moonring (I haven't quite decided yet)
- **Interests/hobbies:** Programming, music, video games, and Linux
