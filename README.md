Hi there! I'm Aethari, an American solo dev with a focus on games and systems programming. I've haven't made much, but I'm on my way to completing
several projects.

My GitHub page probably doesn't look pretty impressive right now, but I'm working on big things for the future. I'm sure I'll take little bits and
pieces from my larger projects to make into smaller ones (like [MLog](https://github.com/Aethari/MLog)), so keep checking back to see if I made 
something new :)

## Current projects:
- A fantasy console-like [game framework called Sun16](https://github.com/Aethari/Sun16) that provides less restrictions than most fantasy consoles
- A minimalist, single file [text editor in Lua called Runic](https://github.com/Aethari/Runic)
- An automatic file syncing program [called Amirror](https://github.com/Aethari/Amirror)
- **[Development calendar](Calendar.md)**

### Future projects:
These are things that I **want** to make in the future. Whether or not they will actually get done is another story.
- A (kind of) general purpose raycasting game engine
- Pomodoro tracking app (desktop and terminal)
- A C dynamic string library
- A C command line argument parsing library
- A program to parse C documntation comments (I have a syntax that I use in all of my C code, but it would be nice to auto-generate documentation for it)
- A "plugin" / header for Lua APIs that adds some much-needed file access functions (access(), mkdir(), etc.)

## Skills:
- Lua
- C
- C+Lua API
- SDL
- Game development/programming
- Retro-inspired game music
- (basic) game engine development
- Terminal programs

## Here's some things about me:
- **Favorite language(s):** C + Lua (really just Lua, but C is too powerful to ignore)
- **Favorite text editor:** Nvim/Micro (I jump between them)
- **Interests/hobbies:** Programming, music, video games, biking, and Linux
