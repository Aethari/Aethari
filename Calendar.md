# Aethari's development calendar
A simple, monthly calendar designed to keep me organized and on top of my work.  
If, for some reason, you are here and aren't Aethari, then you probably won't be able to see many of the repos that are linked. This is because I start my projects as 
private and open them when substantial progress has been made.

**Note:** This month starts late, because I created the calendar partway through the month.

*If you are in an environment where it is impossible to develop/test a project (i.e. Windows computer), simply work on the main project instead.*
